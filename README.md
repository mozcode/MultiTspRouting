# Multi TSP Routing with Google Maps API

This repository contains a Master Degree project focused on solving the Multi-Traveling Salesman Problem (Multi-TSP) using real-time data provided by the Google Maps API. The project includes both the core routing algorithms and a web interface for interacting with the routing system.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- **GoogleApi/**: Contains the core logic for interacting with the Google Maps API, including functions to fetch real-time data such as distances and travel times.
- **MultiTspRouting.WebUI/**: The web-based user interface for visualizing and interacting with the routing system. This component allows users to input locations, specify constraints, and view the optimized routes.

## Features

- **Real-Time Routing**: Utilizes Google Maps API to retrieve up-to-date information on distances and travel times.
- **Multi-TSP Solver**: Implements algorithms to solve the Multi-TSP problem, optimizing the routes for multiple salesmen.
- **Web Interface**: A user-friendly web interface for inputting data and viewing results.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle a large number of locations and multiple salesmen efficiently.
